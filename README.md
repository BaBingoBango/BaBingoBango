Hello, I'm Ethan Marshall - nice to meet you! üëã

*Optional: Imagine I'm giving you a firm handshake through the screen.*

Thanks for visiting my page here on GitHub - it's where I've uploaded all the code for my personal programming projects and fun facts about myself available nowhere else!

> **Fun Fact No. 1**<br>
> I don't like peanut butter. No, I'm not allergic. If this is too disturbing, please feel free to leave now and never
> look back. I understand.

If you're still here, please read on to learn more about my programming interests, projects, and education! Alternatively, if you share my views on peanut butter, please contact me immediately and mark your message as top priority.

## üëÄ Interests
In general, I'm a student of computer science, but more specifically interested in the following areas of technology:

 - Software Engineering
 - User Interface & User Experience Design
 - Cross-Platform Software Solutions
 - Theory of Computing & Programming
 - Pok√©mon (my favorite is [Cosmog](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/cosmog)!)

## üå± Knowledge & Education
I'm currently in my first year at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor where I'm studying [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.engin.umich.edu) (oooh!) and the science of wearing just the right amount of layers in the turbulent Michigan climate.

While I still have a lot to learn, from my education at Michigan and elsewhere, I've come to have a grasp on the following technologies and programming languages! Unfortunately, I have yet to learn how to spell the word "unfortunately", which I looked up immediately before writing this.

 - Apple Software Development Kits
 - Swift Programming
 - C++ Programming
 - Java Programming
 - Xcode (Swift, C++)
 - NetBeans (Java)
 - Git, GitHub, and GitLab
 - Writing fun facts

> **Fun Fact No. 2**<br>
> My first exposure to programming was on my 2015 iPad Air! I had a blast learning to code using Apple's [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) app and so have the strongest experience in the Swift language.

## üñ• Projects

I've taken on several personal programming projects, both for learning purposes and being cool purposes (it's totally cool having a published app, right?). As the Swift language has been my learning tool for many years, my projects are almost 100%  Swift (but if you can find the JavaScript, that's 5 points for your Hogwarts house).

What follows is a description of each of my projects here on GitHub. Feel free to peruse the code, download the code, and laugh at my beginner mistakes!

<br>

**Multiqueue**<br>
*Platforms: iOS, iPadOS, macOS*<br>
*Status: In Beta Testing*<br>
*Download Code: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BaBingoBango/Multiqueue)*<br>
*Download App: [TestFlight link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/oJSdQDmo)*

Have you ever given one person the power to DJ at a party or in the car? Their device alone is connected to the speaker system, giving them ultimate control over what music you will be forced to listen to (truly an awesome power not fit for one man alone). Seeing this as the unfair system it is, I created Multiqueue, which allows you to...

 - Host a group music queue using your Apple Music subscription
 - Invite participant devices to send songs to your host device's queue
 - Join a host device's queue to contribute to the group's music *(beta feature: no Apple Music subscription required!)*
 - Set time and song limits to keep too many Justin Bieber songs out of your party *(beta feature)*

This way, the terrible power of being DJ is split amongst many and balance restored to group dynamics across the world. I hope to release this application on Apple's App Store soon!

> **Fun Fact No. 3**<br>
> I have at least one Justin Bieber song in my library. Again, if you feel you must leave at this time, I completely understand.

**Neodex**<br>
*Platforms: iOS, iPadOS, macOS*<br>
*Status: In Development*<br>
*Download Code: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BaBingoBango/Neodex)*<br>

The Pok√©dex, [as defined by the fans](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9dex), is "an electronic device designed to catalogue and provide information regarding the various species of Pok√©mon featured in the Pok√©mon video game, anime and manga series". There are many Pok√©dex tools out there, but I believe mine offers the best offline Pok√©dex experience possible. It features...

 - A visual database of over 2,700 Pok√©mon data items
 - Searching, filtering, and sorting tools
 - Indexing and Spotlight Search compatibility
 - A full teambuilder compatible with [Pok√©mon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com)
 - Global battle statistics, courtesy of [Smogon](https://www.smogon.com)
 - But wait! There's more! ...coming soon, that is.

This is my largest, most complex project by far and has been in on-and-off development for over a year (I guess I should really get on this...) but the development of its web scrapers, UI, and data semantics have helped me greatly in my quest to become the best there ever was (at programming). Also, it has helped me in my quest to have an offline Pok√©dex I actually like.

> **Fun Fact Quiz!**<br>
> I bet you weren't expecting this! Do you remember [my favorite Pok√©mon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/cosmog)? If not, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I'm terribly sorry, but please go ahead and close the tab now. It was nice meeting you though!

**Viruses Aren't Alive**<br>
*Platforms: iOS*<br>
*Status: Completed; Server Deactivated*<br>
*Download Code: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BaBingoBango/Friends-Afar)*

During the COVID-19 pandemic and what was for me the hectic college applications season (I would not wish that on my worst enemy), the idea for an app that could help people feel more connected (and help my applications be more complete) came to me ~~in a profound dream where the code washed over me in beautiful waves~~ when I was sitting on the couch one day.

Due to COVID-19 App Store regulations, it was never publicly released. For this same reason, I had to rename it "Friends Afar", which is totally not as good of a name as the original. While the server was functioning, the app allowed users to...

 - Submit anonymous messages of goodwill to a public SQL database
 - Receive anonymous messages from others by accessing the database
 - Use a "Healthcare Mode" intended for frontline COVID-19 medical staff
 - Block or report users

The server has since been deactivated, but the experience helped me learn about back-end design and interfacing with SQL databases. This being said, the experience was slightly scarring.

> **Fun Fact No. 4**<br>
> I have a slight fear of back-end development, due to my relative lack of experience. Thus, I am actively looking for experience in this area to conquer my fear and be even more super cool!

<br>

**StreakPal**<br>
*Platforms: iOS, iPadOS*<br>
*Status: Completed*<br>
*Download Code: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BaBingoBango/StreakPal)*<br>
*Download App: [App Store link](https://apps.apple.com/app/streakpal/id1587647711)*

While not my first ever app idea, this simple concept became my first-ever complete application and thus holds a special place in my heart and on my resume. ‚ù§Ô∏è

In case you're not a super cool youth like me, the social networking app Snapchat keeps a record of the number of consecutive days two users have sent each other an image or video - the super cool youth know this as a *Snapstreak*.

After falling for this marketing tactic, I accumulated very high streaks (my record is over 900 days!) and subsequently lost some of them. This was very disheartening. So I decided to prevent this from ever happening again and learn to code at the same time! Enter StreakPal! It allows users to...

 - Set up notifications to appear at certain times
 - Mark these notifications as Time Sensitive
 - Set notifications to open Snapchat when tapped on

Certainly a simple app, but making it was the true start of my programming journey and has accumulated over 4,000 impressions on the App Store (with no marketing whatsoever!). So, yeah, I guess you could say...

> **Fun Fact No. 5**<br>
> I am totally super cool.
