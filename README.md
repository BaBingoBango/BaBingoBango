Hello, I'm Ethan Marshall - nice to meet you! üëã

Thanks for visiting my page here on GitHub - it's where I've uploaded all the code for my [personal programming projects](https://github.com/BaBingoBango#-projects) and fun facts about myself available nowhere else! It's also where you can find my [contact information](https://github.com/BaBingoBango#-contact-information).

## üëÄ Interests
In general, I'm a student of computer science, but more specifically interested in the following areas of technology:

 - Software Engineering
 - User Interface & User Experience Design
 - Cross-Platform Software Solutions
 - Theory of Computing & Programming
 - Pok√©mon (my favorite is [Cosmog](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/cosmog)!)

## üå± Knowledge & Education
This fall, I will be entering my second at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor where I'm studying [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.engin.umich.edu) and the science of wearing just the right amount of layers in the turbulent Michigan climate.

While I still have a lot to learn, from my education at Michigan and elsewhere, I've come to have a grasp on the following technologies and programming languages!

 - Apple Software Development Kits
 - Swift Programming
 - C++ Programming
 - Java Programming
 - Xcode (Swift, C++)
 - Visual Studio (C++)

## üñ• Projects

I've taken on several personal programming projects, both for learning purposes and being cool purposes. As the Swift language has been my learning tool for many years, my projects are almost 100% Swift.

What follows is a description of each of my projects here on GitHub. Feel free to peruse the code, download the code, and laugh at my beginner mistakes!

A visual database of hundreds of Pok√©mon species, items, moves, Abilities, types, and natures, featuring worldwide stats, a comparison tool, and a teambuilder compatible with Pok√©mon Showdown!

The Pok√©dex, [as defined by the fans](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9dex), is "an electronic device designed to catalogue and provide information regarding the various species of Pok√©mon featured in the Pok√©mon video game, anime and manga series". There are many Pok√©dex tools out there, but I believe mine offers the best offline Pok√©dex experience possible.

During the COVID-19 pandemic and what was for me the hectic college applications season (I would not wish that on my worst enemy), the idea for an app that could help people feel more connected (and help my applications be more complete) came to me.
