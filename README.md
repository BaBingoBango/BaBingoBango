Hello, I'm Ethan Marshall - nice to meet you! üëã

Thanks for visiting my page here on GitHub - it's where I've uploaded all the code for my [coding projects](https://github.com/BaBingoBango#-projects)! It's also where you can find my [contact info](https://github.com/BaBingoBango#-contact-information).

## üëÄ Interests
In general, I'm interested in computer science, but more specifically in the following areas:

 - Software Engineering
 - User Interface & User Experience Design
 - Cross-Platform Software Solutions
 - Theory of Computing & Programming
 - Pok√©mon (my favorite is [Cosmog](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/cosmog)!)

## üå± Knowledge & Education
I am a sophomore at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor where I'm studying [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.engin.umich.edu) and the science of wearing just the right amount of layers in the turbulent Michigan climate.

While I still have a lot to learn, from my education at Michigan and elsewhere, I've come to have a grasp on the following technologies and programming languages!

 - Apple Software Development Kits
 - Xcode (Swift, C/C++)
 - Visual Studio (C/C++)
 - Visual Studio Code (Python)
 - Git, GitHub, and GitLab

## üñ• Projects

I've taken on several coding projects, both for learning purposes and random purposes. I've always used Swift for learning, so a lot of my projects are Apple-focused.
